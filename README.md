# CBOW-Embedding-Model
This project implements the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model to learn word embeddings. It includes preprocessing text, creating context windows, one-hot encoding, and building a neural network to generate embeddings. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of learned embeddings.
